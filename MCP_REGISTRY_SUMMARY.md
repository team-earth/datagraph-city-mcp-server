## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# On GitHub.com:
# - Organization: team-earth
# - Name: datagraph-city-mcp-server
# - Visibility: PUBLIC (required)
# - Don't initialize with anything
```

### 2. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
cd /root/datagraph-city-mcp-server
git remote add origin https://github.com/team-earth/datagraph-city-mcp-server.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Configure NPM Token
1. Generate automation token at: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/YOUR_USERNAME/tokens
2. Add as GitHub secret: `NPM_TOKEN`
3. Location: https://github.com/team-earth/datagraph-city-mcp-server/settings/secrets/actions

### 4. Publish First Version
```bash
cd /root/datagraph-city-mcp-server
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow will automatically:
- ✅ Publish to NPM
- ✅ Publish to MCP Registry
- ✅ Create GitHub Release

---

## 📦 Publishing Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow (`publish-mcp.yml`) triggers on version tags:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0      # Initial release
git tag v1.0.1      # Patch release
git tag v1.1.0      # Minor release
git tag v2.0.0      # Major release
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Automated Steps:**
1. Updates version in `package.json` and `server.json`
2. Installs dependencies
3. Publishes to NPM with `--access public`
4. Authenticates with MCP Registry via GitHub OIDC (no manual login needed)
5. Publishes to MCP Registry
6. Creates GitHub Release with install instructions
